# Steal this Site

Welcome to **Steal this Site** â€“ a blueprint for building your own personal website with **Astro** as a wrapper and **React** components for interactivity. Inspired by the ethos of *Steal This Book*, this project is yours to fork, adapt, and make your own.

---

## Who is this for?

- **Tinkerers and Makers** â€“ If you love learning by doing, this is a perfect starting point.  
- **New Coders** - Working on this project will help you get from "I know HTML" to "I know how to launch a modern webpage".
- **People Who Want a Minimalist Personal Site** - A clutter free landing page on the internet that YOU built, YOUR way.
- **Anyone Interested in Docs-as-Code** - Technical writers, engineers, project managers... whoever you are and whatever you make, leave the Word files behind. 

In short, this is for **anyone** regardless of programming skill who wants to start small, learn enough to be dangerous, and make your own corner of the Internet.

---

## What's Inside

This repo contains: 

- A *mininalist* **Astro** site skeleton
- A few simple **React** components (for our *Hero*, *About*, *Contact*, and other sections)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **AsciiDoc documentation** (`/docs/`) â€“ project-specific docs: usage, customization, deployment 

---

## Highlights

- Fully documented in AsciiDoc for Docs-as-Code best practices  
- Clear, easy-to-follow project structure â€“ perfect for learning and tinkering  
- Interactive **React** components wrapped in static **Astro** pages  
- **Ready to deploy** to **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify** with minimal configuration  
- Designed for easy forking and adaptation â€“ start with this and make it your own!

Here's what the project file structure looks like:

```

## Some Terminal Advice

To get the most out of this project, you'll need to be comfortable using the **terminal**, or command line interface.

You'll be using the terminal to:
- Clone this repo with **Git**
- Install dependencies with **pnpm**
- Run the local development server (Astro)
- Deploy your code to platforms like **GitHub Pages** or **Neflify**

**Mac/Linux users** â€“ Youâ€™re probably already familiar with the terminal (Terminal.app, iTerm, etc.).  

**Windows users** â€“ We recommend using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for a smoother experience. While it is possible to perform these tasks using **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**, you'll have a much smoother experience if you choose to use WSL because it gives you a *real* Linux bottled environment inside of Windows where modern web tools (Astro, Node, etc.) work exactly as intended, without clunky workarounds.

  [Hereâ€™s a quick guide to installing WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Tools You'll Need

To complete this project, you'll need the following:

- **Visual Code Studio** - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful, user-friendly, and free code editor produced by Microsoft. It has a great community of developers who provide extentions for working with just about every programming language/framework/et cetera you can think of. If you think VSCode isn't for you, take a look at some alternatives and pick a code editor you vibe with the most.

- **Node.js** - The JavaScript runtime environment that powers Astro and React. Node allows you to run JavaScript tools like build scripts and servers outside of a browser. Whenever you install packages (see: pnpm), or run a development server, that's Node working in the background. Install guide: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

- **pnpm** - This project uses pnpm as its *package manager*, or, the tool that manages the *software libraries* our project depends on. "What's a software library?" Software libraries, also called *dependencies* are pre-written code meant to solve common problems like creating interactive user interfaces (**React**), page stying (**Tailwind CSS**), or building static webpages (**Astro**). Rather than writing all that code from scratch, modern developers can simply install these *building blocks* into your project and use them where and how you'd like.

  The *package manager* is the tool that handles all that for you, it: 
  - *Downloads* these libraries from the **npm registry** (a huge warehouse of open-source code)
  - *Keeps track* of what versions your project uses so updates don't break anything
  - *Organizes* these libraries in a folder called `node_modules/` so the developer doesn't have to worry about anything
  - *Removes* those libraries cleanly when your done with them
   
    Later, when you run the command `pnpm install` in the terminal, you're telling the package manager to fetch all the libraries your project relies on. [Official pnpm Install Guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

- **Git** is an example of a *distributed version control system (VCS)*, created by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2005, it has become a *foundational technology* in software development. Basically, Git tracks changes in a code base by creating **commits** or *snapshots* that capture whatever changes that have been made since the last commit in what's called a **repository** or **repo** . If you make a change and it breaks your program, you can simply *revert* back to an earlier commit when everything was working properly. If you want to try something new, you can create a **branch** - a parallel version of your project - and **merge** those changes back into your main code later if desired. Install guide: [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

- **GitHub** is the cloud-based home for your Git repo. Itâ€™s built around Git but adds a powerful layer of tools for collaboration, discussion, and sharing.

  GitHub:
  - **Hosts your code**, allowing you to share your project with the world.
  - **Tracks issues**, helping you manage bugs, tasks, and improvements.
  - **Reviews changes**, enabling you to propose updates and collaborate with teammates through pull requests.
  - **Deploys directly**, making it easy to publish your site with services like Netlify and GitHub Pages.

  Joining GitHub means joining a larger world of developersâ€”people who share, fork, remix, and collaborate to build better software together.

  If youâ€™re new to GitHub, itâ€™s free to join and has tons of resources to help you get started: [GitHub Sign Up](https://github.com/).

- The Terminal â€“ Your command center, where youâ€™ll run build commands and deploy your site.

  ðŸ’¡ I personally use the built-in terminal in VSCodeâ€”itâ€™s convenient and works the same across Mac, Linux, and Windows (with WSL).

## Why this workflow matters

This workflowâ€”cloning the code, running it locally, and deploying it to Netlifyâ€”mirrors how real-world development and deployment work. Itâ€™s a simple but powerful process that lets you test and tweak your changes safely before sharing them with the world. By following these steps, youâ€™re not just setting up a personal siteâ€”youâ€™re learning the same process used by professional developers every day.
