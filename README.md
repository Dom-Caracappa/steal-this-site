## Some Terminal Advice

To get the most out of this project, you'll need to be comfortable using the **terminal**, or command line interface.

You'll be using the terminal to:
- Clone this repo with **Git**
- Install dependencies with **pnpm**
- Run the local development server (Astro)
- Deploy your code to platforms like **GitHub Pages** or **Neflify**

**Mac/Linux users** â€“ Youâ€™re probably already familiar with the terminal (Terminal.app, iTerm, etc.).  
**Windows users** â€“ We recommend using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for a smoother experience.

## Tools You'll Need

To complete this project, you'll need the following:

- **Visual Code Studio** - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful, user-friendly, and free code editor produced by Microsoft. It has a great community of developers who provide extentions for working with just about every programming language/framework/et cetera you can think of. If you think VSCode isn't for you, take a look at some alternatives and pick a code editor you vibe with the most.
